# Histogram
Histogram of the number of lettters of the words of a file

## How to try it?
Just download the .c file, and execute the following command in order to create the executable.
```
gcc histograma.c -o histogram
```
Then, you can try just running the executable.

Note : The program will read from the STD_INPUT, so I reccomend you to use it like this
```
./histogram <file.txt
```
